## Details

The home page contains a list of streams. Once a stream is clicked, the end-user will be taken
to the stream's profile page where they can learn more information about the stream, and the stream will automatically play.

Users can click on "Back to Index" to return to the home page and check out other streams.

Note: Some of the streams do not work, even when visiting the stream's url address in a browser.
